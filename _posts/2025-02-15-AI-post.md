Since my last LinkedIn post in January, I've made some exciting progress. Last time, I mentioned one of the next implementation goals for my game engine was audio. Well I've added audio, and a bit more:

1. Run in browser by targeting WASM
2. Audio input and output
3. On-device speech-to-text
4. On-device AI language model
5. Text-to-speech with ElevenLabs

These days everyone is talking about AI and how it can be used for so many things. But most of the time people are talking about behemoths like OpenAI and Claude.

I believe there is as much potential, if not more, in edge or local AI. The purpose of this new demo is to showcase how local AI can be used to empower storytelling and emergent behaviour in games and other media. And the results are fantastic even on resource-constrained targets like the web!

Although there are still a few issues to overcome, I am convinced that games can rise to new heights by using this technology strategically. I am so hyped to keep going and see where I land!

Next target: VR - native and web.

Keen to get in touch with innovators in this space and collaborate!
