I never thought I would ever target web, but here we are: the demo scene working on web! Check it out [here](https://no-brainer-games.web.app/main.html).

I was inspired by Michael Tuttle's article about [pixel buffer rendering](https://tuttlem.github.io/2024/12/07/pixel-buffer-rendering-in-wasm-with-rust.html), and since Diligent Engine had just added a WebGPU backend, I decided to try it out. There were a few challenges to get it to work, but there were fewer than expected.

I figured my first priority was figuring out how to compile the project to WASM. I searched around and [got started](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/index.html) with setting Emscripten on my system. It was straightforward to set up on my Mac. I needed to get the Nim compiler to use this, and a quick search took me to [treeform's emscripten tutorial](https://github.com/treeform/nim_emscripten_tutorial). To my pleasant surprise, it also had a nice tutorial about integrating GLFW, which is exactly what I use with Vulkan. Did you know that Emscripten implements [several libraries](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/emscripten-runtime-environment.html#input-output) and all you have to do is link to them at build time? Well I didn't, and I was stoked to find out.

With that out of the way, the next step was [compiling Diligent to WASM](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine?tab=readme-ov-file#build_and_run_emscripten). I was confused about how libraries worked in WASM, so I floundered a bit here. Do libraries (`*.a`, `*.dylib`) exist in WASM in the first place? How do I link to them? It turned out that WASM libraries do exist, and I simply needed to copy the produced `*.a` files from Diligent's build folder.

Eventually I got the engine to compile, so I proceeded to run it. Diligent is able to convert HLSL to WGSL internally for the WebGPU backend, so I hoped that things would work out. Unfortunately, things weren't that simple. First of all, I was hitting [WebGPU limits](https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.Limits.html), like the number of dynamic buffers that can be attached to a pipeline. And the size of these dynamic buffers. And unified mapped buffers don't exist in WebGPU...

Simple solution? Comment out everything that don't immediately work, and compile again. And guess what...

[Tint](https://github.com/google/dawn/tree/main/src/tint) couldn't translate some of the HLSL code I was using! The builtin shader translation pipeline goes something like this:

```
Nim >-[Nim shader transpiler]-> HLSL >-[SPIRV-cross]-> SPIRV >-[tint]-> WGSL
```

After days of debugging, I found that there is a fundamental difference between how [atomics are handled in HLSL vs WGSL](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/issues/2377), and `tint` was having trouble translating between them. Fortunately Diligent allows providing SPIRV and WGSL directly to its backends, so I decided to try generating the WGSL at build time and passing it to Diligent. The new shader translation pipeline then looked like:

```
Nim >-[Nim shader transpiler]-> HLSL >-[DirectXCompiler]-> SPIRV >-[naga]-> WGSL
```

With this setup, I generate SPIRV from HLSL using the `dxc` tool that comes bundled with the Vulkan SDK (on all platforms!), and then pass that SPIRV to [naga-cli](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/tree/trunk/naga) which is part of the WebGPU repository. I packaged all this up in a `nim gen shader` command which I would run before building the main project.

I had to make a few adjustments the shaders, like enabling runtime-sized resource arrays, using texture arrays instead of arrays of textures in WebGPU, and merging dynamic buffers to overcome size limits. There are still a few missing features, but the basic functionality is there.
