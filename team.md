## Hi, I'm Ryan!

By day I am a software engineer with 10+ years professional experience in areas including games, virtual reality, native mobile, Flutter, and web backend.

By night I work on my life-long passion project dubbed No Brainer Games, where I constantly challenge my technical skills and creativity.

If you're interested in collaborating or discussing your own projects, please get in touch!

## Anna here!

I am a music producer, architectural designer, and 3D artist.

Half of the week, I run my own music production studio called Rough Draft, and also teach music instruments to kids. The other half, I'm doing business development with No Brainer Games.

It's pretty cool.
